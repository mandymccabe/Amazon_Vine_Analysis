# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview

This analysis looks at whether bias is created from the Amazon Vine Program.  The Amazon Vine Program lets companies pay Amazon a small fee and in return Amazon Vine Program members receive that company's product and are required to write a review of the product.  This analysis looks at whether the program biases reviews to be more positive vs. non program revies.

## Summary
There was less than .01% difference between the percent of 5 star reviews that were part of the Vine Program versus those that were not.  Based off of this results, it does not appear that the Vine Program causes a bias toward positive reviews.  Analyzing more datasets would be beneficial to provide additional support for or against this conclusion.
